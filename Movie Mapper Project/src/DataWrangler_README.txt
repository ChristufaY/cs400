Team: Red
Files Written by Me:
--------------------
<List all files that were within this project that were written by you, and
 include a short description of the purpose that each file servers>
Movie.java -> implements "MovieInterface.java". This is the class that contains the name of the movie, year it was made, director, duraion, etc.
MovieDataReader.java -> implements "MovieDataReaderInterface.java". This is the class that reads through the csv file and splits its into a String[], handles all exceptions thrown, and sorts the movies by rating
TestMovieDataReader.java -> tests "Movie.java" and "MovieDataReader.java" classes to make sure that they function as intended and handles errors.
Additional Contributions:
-------------------------
<List any additional contributions that you have made toward your team's
 completion of this project.  This might include, but is not limited to things
 like: organizing team communication, creating extra tests or dummy classes,
 assisting team members in any way, etc.>
Team members did not ask for any help. I did however help the blue team's data wrangler implement their class. I did not share my own code, just gave pointers on what needs to be done :).
