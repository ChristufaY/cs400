We are at rest five miles behind the front. Yesterday we were relieved, and now our bellies are
full of beef and haricot beans. We are satisfied and at peace. Each man has another mess-tin full
for the evening; and, what is more, there is a double ration of sausage and bread.
So I crafted a double hotdog, threw some ketchup on that bad boy and gobbled it up.
