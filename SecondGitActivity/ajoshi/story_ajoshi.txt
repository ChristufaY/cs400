Everything was just fine and normal one moment, and then the next it was like the world was on fire. The windows shattered, the furniture shook, the walls shuddered and I was thrown to the floor.
It just so happens that I tripped down the stairs and broke everything. Then it was darkness. Pitch black. The 
world has ended. All thanks to my fall.
