Once upon a time there was a young tiger prowling through the barren safari lands.
He was trying his best to stay hidden when all of a sudden he heard the loud noise.
The tiger was tranquilized and boxed up. The tiger woke up to the sound of ocean waves hit his head
on the side of the box. A little light peeked through a tiny hole on the side of the box. He then heard a
giraffe named Mel and zebra named Marty greet him. The lion's name was Alex and they were on a boat to 
the New York zoo.
