## 📁 Highlights

### 🔹 Core Projects

- **Dijkstra's Shortest Path**: Implemented Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest paths in a graph, emphasizing efficient data structure usage and algorithm optimization.

- **Red-Black Tree**: Developed a self-balancing binary search tree to maintain sorted data, ensuring operations like insertions and deletions occur in logarithmic time.

- **Hash Table**: Created a custom hash table with open addressing and linear probing, handling collisions and dynamic resizing.

- **Movie Mapper Project**: Built an interactive application that maps movies to their filming locations using JavaFX, integrating GUI components with backend data processing.

### 🔹 GUI Development

- **JavaFX Activities**: Designed multiple applications using JavaFX, enhancing user interface skills and event-driven programming.

### 🔹 Testing and Version Control

- **JUnit Activity**: Wrote unit tests using JUnit to ensure code reliability and correctness.

- **Git Activities**: Practiced version control workflows, including branching, merging, and collaboration using Git.
